# Fakenote Studio

(WIP) Design files, assets and notes from the Flipnote Switch mockup that was part of our community's 2020 April Fools prank.

### Background

Flipnote Studio is a free animation app available on the Nintendo DSi and 3DS. As part of an elaborate annual April Fools prank in a few small Flipnote-centric communities on Discord, we decided to fake some "leaked" screenshots of an new version of the app for the Nintendo Switch. 

Unbeknownst to us, somebody in the community ended up going to some press outlets with the screenshots. In typical gaming journalism fashion the setchy source was ignored and the "leaks" ended up going semi-viral. Once we revealed ourselves as the source of the fake screenshots, there was a significant amount of backlash from disappointed fans, with some going so far as to call for us to be doxxed or murdered. (yikes)

You can catch the whole story [on IGN](https://uk.ign.com/articles/the-april-fools-switch-joke-that-went-too-far).

But amongst all of the vitriol I ended up being contacted by a handful of developers who liked the UI designs and were interested in using them for their own homebrew animation applications. Seeing a potentially positive outcome to the whole fiasco, I figured I'd open-source everything we made under a permissive, do-whatever-the-heck-you-want-with-it liscense!

### Changes Since the "Leaks"

* Stripped out Nintendo assets such as the Flipnote frogs
* Changed official logos to "Fakenote Studio" / "うそメモ帳"
* Fixed Japanese text and provided English translations for everything
* Fixed various layout and alignment issues

So far there aren't any more screen layouts or icons beyond the ones featured in the leaks, but I may consider adding extra things if people want them!
